### Start the dev server:

```

npm run start:dev

```

### Build:

```

npm run build

```

#### Note:

- Changes made to your CSS / JS triggers a full page auto-reload.
- Running a build writes the `bundle.js` and `bundle.css` to the `/public/dist/` directory.

### Pre-configured tools and plugins

- Module bundler: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- ES6 Transpiler: [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
- Linting: [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- JS Uglification: [UglifyJsPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin/)
- Dev Server: [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) (`npm run start:dev`)
